# CyberPatriotNotes

## About this project...
This is a collection of notes for CyberPatriot, an American cybersecurity contest. "Singaporean Tech Support" is the unofficial name for my school's team and does not refer to any actual tech support service.

## Built with...
- Cisco Packet Tracer (for testing Cisco tasks)
- VMware (for running virtual machines)

## Prerequisites
You do not need anything to read the notes. However, you need the relevant system images and VMware to run the virtual machines to practise system securing (system hardening). You will also need Cisco Packet Tracer to practise Cisco tasks. A sample Cisco README is provided in this repository.

## Installation
Just look at the notes or download it if you want.

## Using the software...
Included in this repository are 2 system securing checklists and some Cisco resources. "WindowAndServerSecure.txt" contains instructions on how to secure a Windows or Windows Server computer, and "LinuxSecure.txt" contains instructions on how to secure a Linux computer. Depending on the system version and configuration, some steps may differ.

The other 4 files are for Cisco tasks. "CiscoReadme.txt" is a sample README for a Cisco Packet Tracer task. You may build the question setup yourself from the in front part of "InstructionsCisco.txt" or simply use "blank template.pkt". Instructions on how to complete the task is found in "InstructionsCisco.txt", and you can see the completed network in "completed network.pkt".
